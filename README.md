# Balloon_FeatureDetection
Feature detection algorithm in beta test that allow to process imagery from a balloon without metadata

To run this Python script, the user needs to install the following libraries:

OpenCV (cv2): This library is used for computer vision tasks such as reading images, detecting features, and processing images.

Install using: pip install opencv-python
NumPy (numpy): NumPy is used for numerical operations such as array manipulations and transformations.

Install using: pip install numpy
Matplotlib (pyplot): Matplotlib is used for plotting and visualizing images and other data.

Install using: pip install matplotlib
OS Module (os): This is part of the Python standard library, so no additional installation is needed. It provides functions for interacting with the operating system (e.g., listing directories, handling file paths).

Time Module (time): This is part of the Python standard library. It is used for timing events and measuring the duration of code execution.

USE:
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
